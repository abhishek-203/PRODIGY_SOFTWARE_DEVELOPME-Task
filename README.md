# PRODIGY_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT
Overview
This project is a Java application that includes implementations for three different tasks:

# Sudoku Solver
# Temperature Converter
#Number Guessing Game
Each task is implemented as a separate feature within the application.

# Sudoku Solver
The Sudoku Solver feature is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles. It takes an incomplete Sudoku puzzle as input and fills in the missing numbers based on Sudoku rules until the puzzle is solved.

Usage
To use the Sudoku Solver:

Input an incomplete Sudoku puzzle in the provided format.
Run the solver.
The application will display the solved Sudoku puzzle.

# Temperature Converter
The Temperature Converter feature allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

Usage
To use the Temperature Converter:

Select the temperature unit of the input value.
Enter the temperature value.
Select the target temperature unit for conversion.
Run the conversion.
The application will display the converted temperature value.

# Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game feature is a simple game where the computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
